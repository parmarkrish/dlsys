Up until now, you have largely been using numpy for this purpose, but this homework will walk you through developing what amounts to your own (albeit much more limited) variant of numpy, which will support both CPU and GPU backends.  What's more, unlike numpy (and even variants like PyTorch), you won't simply call out to existing highly-optimized variants of matrix multiplication or other manipulation code, but actually write your own versions that are reasonably competitive will the highly optimized code backing these standard libraries (by some measure, i.e., \"only 2-3x slower\" ... which is a whole lot better than naive code that can easily be 100x slower).  This class will ultimately be integrated into `needle`, but for this assignment you can _only_ focus on the ndarray module, as this will be the only subject of the tests.\n","\n"],"id":"b38216e2"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"id":"db5a484c","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1669062612078,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":19843,"user":{"displayName":"Krish Parmar","userId":"11918132376288757432"}},"outputId":"34c25fc4-d411-49ba-d2e0-f88a520d6a03"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Mounted at /content/drive\n","/content/drive/MyDrive\n","/content/drive/MyDrive/10714\n","fatal: destination path 'hw3' already exists and is not an empty directory.\n","/content/drive/MyDrive/10714/hw3\n","Looking in indexes: https://pypi.org/simple, https://us-python.pkg.dev/colab-wheels/public/simple/\n","Collecting git+https://github.com/dlsys10714/mugrade.git\n","  Cloning https://github.com/dlsys10714/mugrade.git to /tmp/pip-req-build-mc45vvur\n","  Running command git clone -q https://github.com/dlsys10714/mugrade.git /tmp/pip-req-build-mc45vvur\n","Building wheels for collected packages: mugrade\n","  Building wheel for mugrade (setup.py) ... \u001b[?25l\u001b[?25hdone\n","  Created wheel for mugrade: filename=mugrade-1.2-py3-none-any.whl size=3969 sha256=9cd01b7ecc2c1f764d0c72d69570aebc7aac81b4415c00b63a24af52efb20cc9\n","  Stored in directory: /tmp/pip-ephem-wheel-cache-yt69wtum/wheels/15/84/8e/0b0cd7631b7172a69b25dffca173268d4f66e81e0e70f9e79e\n","Successfully built mugrade\n","Installing collected packages: mugrade\n","Successfully installed mugrade-1.2\n","Looking in indexes: https://pypi.org/simple, https://us-python.pkg.dev/colab-wheels/public/simple/\n","Collecting pybind11\n","  Downloading pybind11-2.10.1-py3-none-any.whl (216 kB)\n","\u001b[K     |████████████████████████████████| 216 kB 4.5 MB/s \n","\u001b[?25hInstalling collected packages: pybind11\n","Successfully installed pybind11-2.10.1\n"]}],"source":["# Code to set up the assignment\n","from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')\n","%cd /content/drive/MyDrive/\n","!mkdir -p 10714\n","%cd /content/drive/MyDrive/10714\n","!git clone https://github.com/dlsys10714/hw3.git\n","%cd /content/drive/MyDrive/10714/hw3\n","\n","!pip3 install --upgrade --no-deps git+https://github.com/dlsys10714/mugrade.git\n","!pip3 install pybind11"],"id":"db5a484c"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":62,"metadata":{"id":"09eedbc6","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1669071782708,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":16446,"user":{"displayName":"Krish Parmar","userId":"11918132376288757432"}},"outputId":"4856a65f-af9e-4935-baf4-d003c2709569"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["-- Found pybind11: /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/pybind11/include (found version \"2.10.1\")\n","-- Found cuda, building cuda backend\n","Mon Nov 21 23:02:46 2022       \n","+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n","| NVIDIA-SMI 460.32.03    Driver Version: 460.32.03    CUDA Version: 11.2     |\n","|-------------------------------+----------------------+----------------------+\n","| GPU  Name        Persistence-M| Bus-Id        Disp.A | Volatile Uncorr.

The code is fairly brief (it's ~500 lines, but a lot of these are comments provided for the functions you'll implement).\n","\n","At its core, the NDArray class is a Python wrapper for handling operations on generic n-dimensional arrays.  Recall that virtually any such array will be stored internally as a vector of floating point values, i.e.,\n","\n","```c++\n","float data[size];\n","```\n","\n","and then the actual access to different dimensions of the array are all handled by additional fields (such as the array shape, strides, etc) that indicates how this \"flat\" array maps to n-dimensional structure.  In order to achieve any sort of reasonable speed, the \"raw\" operations (like adding, binary operations, but also more structured operations like matrix multiplication, etc), all need to be written at some level in some native language like C++ (including e.g., making CUDA calls).  But a large number of operations likes transposing, broadcasting, sub-setting of matrices, and other, can all be handled by just adjusting the high-level structure of the array, like it's strides.\n","\n","The philosophy behind the NDArray class is that we want _all_ the logic for handling this structure of the array to be written in Python.  Only the \"true\" low level code that actually performs the raw underlying operations on the flat vector (as well as the code to manage these flat vectors, as they might need to e.g., be allocated on GPUs), is written in C++.  The precise nature of this separation will likely start to make more sense to you as you work through the assignment, but generally speaking everything that can be done in Python, is done in Python; often e.g., at the cost of some inefficiencies ... we call `.compact()` (which copies memory) liberally in order to make the underlying C++ implementations simpler.\n","\n","In more detail, there are five fields within the NDArray class that you'll need to be familiar with (note that the real class member these all these fields is preceded by an underscore, e.g., `_handle`, `_strides`, etc, some of which are then exposed as a public property ... for all your code it's fine to use the internal, underscored version).\n","\n","1. `device` - A object of type `BackendDevice`, which is a simple wrapper that contains a link to the underlying device backend (e.g., CPU or CUDA).\n","2. `handle` - A class objected that stores the underlying memory of the array.  This is allocated as a class of type `device.Array()`, though this allocation all happens in the provided code (specifically the `NDArray.make` function), and you don't need to worry about calling it yourself.\n","3. `shape` - A tuple specifying the size of each dimension in the array.\n","4. `strides` - A tuple specifying the strides of each dimension in the array.\n","5. `offset` - An integer indicating where in the underlying `device.Array` memory the array actually starts (it's convenient to store this so we can more easily manage pointing back to existing memory, without having to track allocations).\n","\n","By manipulating these fields, even pure Python code can perform a lot of the needed operations on the array, such as permuting the dimensions (i.e., transposing), broadcasting, and more.  And then for the raw array manipulation calls, the `device` class has a number of methods (implemented in C++) that contains the necessary implementations.\n","\n","There are a few points to note:\n","\n","* Internally, the class can use _any_ efficient means of operating on arrays of data as a \"device\" backend.  Even, for example, a numpy array, but where instead of actually using the `numpy.ndarray` to represent the n-dimensional array, we just represent a \"flat\" 1D array in numpy, then call the relevant numpy methods to implement all the needed operators on this raw memory.  This is precisely what we do in the `ndarray_backend_numpy.py` file, which essentially provided a \"stub reference\" that just uses numpy for everything.  You can use this class to help you  better debug your own \"real\" implementations for the \"native\" CPU and GPU backends.\n","* Of particular importance for many of your Python implementations will be the `NDArray.make` call:\n","```python\n","def make(shape, strides=None, device=None, handle=None, offset=0):\n","```\n","which creates a new NDArray with the given shape, strides, device, handle, and offset.  If `handle` is not specified (i.e., no pre-existing memory is referenced), then the call will allocate the needed memory, but if handle _is_ specified then no new memory is allocated, but the new NDArray points the same memory as the old one.  It is important to efficient implementations that as many of your functions as possible _don't_ allocate new memory, so you will want to use this call in many cases to accomplish this.\n","* The NDArray has a `.numpy()` call that converts the array to numpy.  This is _not_ the same as the \"numpy_device\" backend: this creates an actual `numpy.ndarray` that is equivalent to the given NDArray, i.e., the same dimensions, shape, etc, though not necessarily the same strides (Pybind11 will reallocate memory for matrices that are returned in this manner, which can change the striding).\n"],"id":"899bc262"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"cc7c24db"},"source":["## Part 1: Python array operations\n","\n","As a starting point for your class, implement the following functions in the `ndarray.py` file:\n","\n","- `reshape()`\n","- `permute()`\n","- `broadcast_to()`\n","- `__getitem__()`\n","\n","The inputs/outputs of these functions are all described in the docstring of the function stub.  It's important to emphasize that _none_ of these functions should reallocate memory, but should instead return NDArrays that share the same memory with `self`, and just use clever manipulation of shape/strides/etc in order to obtain the necessary transformations.\n","\n","One thing to note is that the `__getitem__()` call, unlike numpy, will never change the number of dimensions in the array.  So e.g., for a 2D NDArray `A`, `A[2,2]` would return a still-2D with one row and one column.  And e.g. `A[:4,2]` would return a 2D NDarray with 4 rows and 1 column.\n","\n","You can rely on the `ndarray_backend_numpy.py` module for all the code in this section.

Recall that a matrix is considered compact if it is layed out sequentially in memory in \"row-major\" form (but really a generalization of row-many to higher dimensional arrays), i.e. with the last dimension first, followed by the second to last dimension, etc, all the way to the first.  In our implementation, we also require that the total size of allocated backend array be equal to the size of the array (i.e., the underlying array also can't have any data before or after the array data, which e.g., implies that the `.offset` field equals zero).\n","\n","Now let's consider, using a 3D array as a an example, of how a compact call might work.  Here `shape` and `strides` are the shape and strides of the matrix being compacted (i.e., before we have compacted it).\n","\n","```c++\n","cnt = 0;\n","for (size_t i = 0; i < shape[0]; i++)\n","    for (size_t j = 0; j < shape[1]; j++)\n","        for (size_t k = 0; k < shape[2]; k++)\n","            out[cnt++] = in[strides[0]*i + strides[1]*j + strides[2]*k];\n","```\n","In other words, we're converting from a stride-based representation of the matrix to a purely sequential one.\n","\n","Now, the challenge in implementing `Compact()` is that you want the method to work for any number of input dimensions.  It's easy to specialize for different fixed-dimension-size arrays, but for a generic implementation, you'll want to think about how to do this same operation where you effectively want a \"variable number of for loops\".  As a hint, one way to do this is to maintain a vector of indices (of size equal to the number of dimensions), and then manually increment them in a loop (including a \"carry\" operation when any of the reaches their maximum size).\n","\n","However, if you get really stuck with this, you can alway use the fact that we're probably not going to ask you to deal with matrices of more than 6 dimensions (though we _will_ use 6 dimensions, for the im2col operation we discussed in class).\n","\n","\n","#### The connection to setitem\n","The setitem functionality, while seemingly quite different, is actually intimately related to `Compact()`.  `__setitem()__` is the Python function called when setting some elements of the object, i.e.,\n","```python\n","A[::2,4:5,9] = 0 # or = some_other_array\n","```\n","How would you go about implementing this?  In the `__getitem()__` call above, you already implemented a method to take a subset of a matrix without copying (but just modifying strides).  But how would you actually go about _setting_ elements of this array?  In virtually all the other settings in this homework, we call `.compact()` before setting items in an output array, but in this case it doesn't work: calling `.compact()` would copy the subset array to some new memory, but the whole point of the `__setitem__()` call is that we want to modify existing memory.\n","\n","If you think about this for a while, you'll realize that the answer looks a lot like `.compact()` but in reverse.  If we want to assign a (itself already compact) right hand side matrix to a `__getitem()__` results, then we need to here like `shape` and `stride` be those fields of the _output_ matrix.  Then we could implement the setitem call as follows\n","\n","```c++\n","cnt = 0;\n","for (size_t i = 0; i < shape[0]; i++)\n","    for (size_t j = 0; j < shape[1]; j++)\n","        for (size_t k = 0; k < shape[2]; k++)\n","            out[strides[0]*i + strides[1]*j + strides[2]*k] = in[cnt++]; // or \"= val;\"\n","```\n","Due to this similarity, if you implement your indexing strategy in a modular fashion, you'll be able to reuse it between the `Compact()` call and the `EwiseSetitem()` and `ScalarSetitem()` calls."],"id":"21f48d27"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"758969a1","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1668982167840,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":1561,"user":{"displayName":"Krish Parmar","userId":"11918132376288757432"}},"outputId":"ca924d5d-bb6a-483c-8fca-5ac2bb901963"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\u001b[1m============================= test session starts ==============================\u001b[0m\n","platform linux -- Python 3.7.15, pytest-3.6.4, py-1.11.0, pluggy-0.7.1 -- /usr/bin/python3\n","cachedir: .pytest_cache\n","rootdir: /content/drive/MyDrive/10714/hw3, inifile:\n","plugins: typeguard-2.7.1\n","collected 136 items / 121 deselected                                           \u001b[0m\n","\n","tests/test_ndarray.py::test_compact[cpu-transpose] \u001b[32mPASSED\u001b[0m\u001b[36m                [  6%]\u001b[0m\n","tests/test_ndarray.py::test_compact[cpu-broadcast_to] \u001b[32mPASSED\u001b[0m\u001b[36m             [ 13%]\u001b[0m\n","tests/test_ndarray.py::test_compact[cpu-reshape1] \u001b[32mPASSED\u001b[0m\u001b[36m                 [ 20%]\u001b[0m\n","tests/test_ndarray.py::test_compact[cpu-reshape2] \u001b[32mPASSED\u001b[0m\u001b[36m                 [ 26%]\u001b[0m\n","tests/test_ndarray.py::test_compact[cpu-reshape3] \u001b[32mPASSED\u001b[0m\u001b[36m                 [ 33%]\u001b[0m\n","tests/test_ndarray.py::test_compact[cpu-getitem1] \u001b[32mPASSED\u001b[0m\u001b[36m                 [ 40%]\u001b[0m\n","tests/test_ndarray.py::test_compact[cpu-getitem2] \u001b[32mPASSED\u001b[0m\u001b[36m                 [ 46%]\u001b[0m\n","tests/test_ndarray.py::test_compact[cpu-transposegetitem] \u001b[32mPASSED\u001b[0m\u001b[36m         [ 53%]\u001b[0m\n","tests/test_ndarray.py::test_setitem_ewise[cpu-params0] \u001b[32mPASSED\u001b[0m\u001b[36m            [ 60%]\u001b[0m\n","tests/test_ndarray.py::test_setitem_ewise[cpu-params1] \u001b[32mPASSED\u001b[0m\u001b[36m            [ 66%]\u001b[0m\n","tests/test_ndarray.py::test_setitem_ewise[cpu-params2] \u001b[32mPASSED\u001b[0m\u001b[36m            [ 73%]\u001b[0m\n","tests/test_ndarray.py::test_setitem_scalar[cpu-params0] \u001b[32mPASSED\u001b[0m\u001b[36m           [ 80%]\u001b[0m\n","tests/test_ndarray.py::test_setitem_scalar[cpu-params1] \u001b[32mPASSED\u001b[0m\u001b[36m           [ 86%]\u001b[0m\n","tests/test_ndarray.py::test_setitem_scalar[cpu-params2] \u001b[32mPASSED\u001b[0m\u001b[36m           [ 93%]\u001b[0m\n","tests/test_ndarray.py::test_setitem_scalar[cpu-params3] \u001b[32mPASSED\u001b[0m\u001b[36m           [100%]\u001b[0m\n","\n","\u001b[32m\u001b[1m================== 15 passed, 121 deselected in 0.62 seconds ===================\u001b[0m\n"]}],"source":["!python3 -m pytest -v -k \"(compact or setitem) and cpu\""],"id":"758969a1"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"74c98f6c","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1668982208686,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":7698,"user":{"displayName":"Krish Parmar","userId":"11918132376288757432"}},"outputId":"afde19ea-87fd-4ada-bd67-049937d02909"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["submit\n","\u001b[1m============================= test session starts ==============================\u001b[0m\n","platform linux -- Python 3.7.15, pytest-3.6.4, py-1.11.0, pluggy-0.7.1\n","rootdir: /content/drive/MyDrive/10714/hw3, inifile:\n","plugins: typeguard-2.7.1\n","collected 9 items / 8 deselected                                               \u001b[0m\n","\n","tests/test_ndarray.py \n","Submitting ndarray_cpu_compact_setitem...\n","Grader test 1 passed\n","Grader test 2 passed\n","Grader test 3 passed\n","Grader test 4 passed\n","Grader test 5 passed\n","Grader test 6 passed\n","Grader test 7 passed\n","Grader test 8 passed\n",".\n","\n","\u001b[32m\u001b[1m==================== 1 passed, 8 deselected in 6.67 seconds ====================\u001b[0m\n"]}],"source":["!python3 -m mugrade submit \"_pP8UKUiuiCLd2x3wEbyS\" -k \"ndarray_cpu_compact_setitem\""],"id":"74c98f6c"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"9df3e8fb"},"source":["## Part 3: CPU Backend -

This is fairly similar to the C++ version, however, depending on how you implemented that function, there could also be some substantial differences.  We specifically want to highlight a few differences between the C++ and the CUDA implementations, however.\n","\n","First, as with the example functions implemented in the CUDA backend code, for all the functions above you will actually want to implement two functions: the basic functions listed above that you will call from Python, and the corresponding CUDA kernels that will actually perform the computation.  For the most part, we only provide the prototype for the \"base\" function in the `ndarray_backend_cuda.cu` file, and you will need to define and implement the kernel function yourself.  However, to see how these work, for the `Compact()` call we are providing you with the _complete_ `Compact()` call, and the function prototype for the `CompactKernel()` call.\n","\n","One thing you may notice is the seemingly odd use of a `CudaVec` struct, which is a struct used to pass shape/stride parameters.  In the C++ version we used the STL `std::vector` variables to store these inputs (and the same is done in the base `Compact()` call, but CUDA kernels cannot operation on STL vectors, so something else is needed).  Furthermore, although we _could_ convert the vectors to normal CUDA arrays, this would be rather cumbersome, as we would need to call `cudaMalloc()`, pass the parameters as integer pointers, then free them after the calls.  Of course such memory management is needed for the actual underlying data in the array, but it seems like overkill to do it for just passing a variable-sized small tuple of shape/stride values.  The solution is to create a struct that has a \"maximize\" size for the number of dimensions an array can have, and then just store the actual shape/stride data in the first entries of these fields.  This is all done by the included `CudaVec` struct and `VecToCuda()` function, and you can just use these as provided for all the CUDA kernels that require passing shape/strides to the kernel itself.\n","\n","The other (more conceptual) big difference between the C++ and CUDA implementations of `Compact()` is that in C++ you will typically loop over the elements of the non-compact array sequentially, which allows you to perform some optimizations with respect to computing the corresponding indices between the compact and non-compact arrays.  In CUDA, you cannot do this, and will need to implement code that can directly map from an index in the compact array to one in the strided array.\n","\n","As before, we recommend you implement your code in such as way that it can easily be re-used between the `Compact()`, and `Setitem()` calls.  As a short note, remember that if you want to call a (separate, non-kernel) function from kernel code, you need to define it as a `__device__` function.\n"],"id":"c44486db"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":15,"metadata":{"id":"480d127f","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1669064733359,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":1658,"user":{"displayName":"Krish Parmar","userId":"11918132376288757432"}},"outputId":"de3c65e9-c9e2-4035-e3d5-18525a70234b"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\u001b[1m============================= test session starts ==============================\u001b[0m\n","platform linux -- Python 3.7.15, pytest-3.6.4, py-1.11.0, pluggy-0.7.1 -- /usr/bin/python3\n","cachedir: .pytest_cache\n","rootdir: /content/drive/MyDrive/10714/hw3, inifile:\n","plugins: typeguard-2.7.1\n","collected 136 items / 121 deselected                                           \u001b[0m\n","\n","tests/test_ndarray.py::test_compact[cuda-transpose] \u001b[32mPASSED\u001b[0m\u001b[36m               [  6%]\u001b[0m\n","tests/test_ndarray.py::test_compact[cuda-broadcast_to] \u001b[32mPASSED\u001b[0m\u001b[36m            [ 13%]\u001b[0m\n","tests/test_ndarray.py::test_compact[cuda-reshape1] \u001b[32mPASSED\u001b[0m\u001b[36m                [ 20%]\u001b[0m\n","tests/test_ndarray.py::test_compact[cuda-reshape2] \u001b[32mPASSED\u001b[0m\u001b[36m                [ 26%]\u001b[0m\n","tests/test_ndarray.py::test_compact[cuda-reshape3] \u001b[32mPASSED\u001b[0m\u001b[36m                [ 33%]\u001b[0m\n","tests/test_ndarray.py::test_compact[cuda-getitem1] \u001b[32mPASSED\u001b[0m\u001b[36m                [ 40%]\u001b[0m\n","tests/test_ndarray.py::test_compact[cuda-getitem2] \u001b[32mPASSED\u001b[0m\u001b[36m                [ 46%]\u001b[0m\n","tests/test_ndarray.py::test_compact[cuda-transposegetitem] \u001b[32mPASSED\u001b[0m\u001b[36m        [ 53%]\u001b[0m\n","tests/test_ndarray.py::test_setitem_ewise[cuda-params0] \u001b[32mPASSED\u001b[0m\u001b[36m           [ 60%]\u001b[0m\n","tests/test_ndarray.py::test_setitem_ewise[cuda-params1] \u001b[32mPASSED\u001b[0m\u001b[36m           [ 66%]\u001b[0m\n","tests/test_ndarray.py::test_setitem_ewise[cuda-params2] \u001b[32mPASSED\u001b[0m\u001b[36m           [ 73%]\u001b[0m\n","tests/test_ndarray.py::test_setitem_scalar[cuda-params0] \u001b[32mPASSED\u001b[0m\u001b[36m          [ 80%]\u001b[0m\n","tests/test_ndarray.py::test_setitem_scalar[cuda-params1] \u001b[32mPASSED\u001b[0m\u001b[36m          [ 86%]\u001b[0m\n","tests/test_ndarray.py::test_setitem_scalar[cuda-params2] \u001b[32mPASSED\u001b[0m\u001b[36m          [ 93%]\u001b[0m\n","tests/test_ndarray.py::test_setitem_scalar[cuda-params3] \u001b[32mPASSED\u001b[0m\u001b[36m          [100%]\u001b[0m\n","\n","\u001b[32m\u001b[1m================== 15 passed, 121 deselected in 0.73 seconds ===================\u001b[0m\n"]}],"source":["!python3 -m pytest -v -k \"(compact or setitem) and cuda\""],"id":"480d127f"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":16,"metadata":{"id":"98a83634","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1669064773305,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":10184,"user":{"displayName":"Krish Parmar","userId":"11918132376288757432"}},"outputId":"2db22ea8-9dc8-404c-ce88-a7da84837f0f"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["submit\n","\u001b[1m============================= test session starts ==============================\u001b[0m\n","platform linux -- Python 3.7.15, pytest-3.6.4, py-1.11.0, pluggy-0.7.1\n","rootdir: /content/drive/MyDrive/10714/hw3, inifile:\n","plugins: typeguard-2.7.1\n","collected 9 items / 8 deselected                                               \u001b[0m\n","\n","tests/test_ndarray.py \n","Submitting ndarray_cuda_compact_setitem...\n","Grader test 1 passed\n","Grader test 2 passed\n","Grader test 3 passed\n","Grader test 4 passed\n","Grader test 5 passed\n","Grader test 6 passed\n","Grader test 7 passed\n","Grader test 8 passed\n",".\n","\n","\u001b[32m\u001b[1m==================== 1 passed, 8 deselected in 9.39 seconds ====================\u001b[0m\n"]}],"source":["!python3 -m mugrade submit \"_pP8UKUiuiCLd2x3wEbyS\" -k \"ndarray_cuda_compact_setitem\""],"id":"98a83634"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"7aa2a94a"},"source":["## Part 7: CUDA Backend - Elementwise and scalar operations\n","\n","Implement the following functions in `ndarray_backend_cuda.cu`:\n","\n","* `EwiseMul()`, `ScalarMul()`\n","* `EwiseDiv()`, `ScalarDiv()`\n","* `ScalarPower()`\n","* `EwiseMaximum()`, `ScalarMaximum()`\n","* `EwiseEq()`, `ScalarEq()`\n","* `EwiseGe()`, `ScalarGe()`\n","* `EwiseLog()`\n","* `EwiseExp()`\n","* `EwiseTanh()`\n","\n","Again, we don't provide these function prototypes, and you're welcome to use C++ templates or macros to make this implementation more compact.
